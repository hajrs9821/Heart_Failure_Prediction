# Heart_Failure_Prediction
A simple machine learning and neural network project that predicts the risk of heart failure based on key clinical features. The model uses patient data such as time, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction to provide an early warning that helps in medical decision-making. Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
